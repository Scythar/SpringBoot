What is a Spring Bean? (Simple Explanation)

A bean is just an object, but…
👉 its lifecycle is managed by Spring, not by you.
You normally create objects like:
ModelMapper mapper = new ModelMapper();
But when we say:
Spring creates it
Spring manages it
Spring injects it
Then that object becomes a Spring Bean.

⭐ So a bean is simply:
✔ An object created by Spring (not by new())
✔ Registered inside Spring container
✔ Reused anywhere using @Autowired
✔ Singleton by default  meaning only one object is created of a class.
✔ Controlled entirely by Spring
⭐ But where do beans come from?

They come from:

1️⃣ Classes annotated with @Component, @Repository, @Service, @Controller, etc.

These get auto-detected.

2️⃣ Methods annotated with @Bean inside a @Configuration class

These are manually created beans (like ModelMapper).

3️⃣ @Bean methods are NOT allowed to take random parameters
Spring can only inject:
other beans
framework objects like ApplicationContext, HttpServletRequest,Authentication,AuthenticationManager

@Bean
public BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder(String password) { ... }❌
public BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder(  ) { ... }✅

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a fundamental design principle in software engineering, where the control over the flow of a program or the creation/management of objects is inverted from the custom user code to a framework or container.
