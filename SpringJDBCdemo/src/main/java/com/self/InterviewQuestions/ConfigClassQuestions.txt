⭐ What is csrf in securityFilterChain() and when it should be disabled?

ANSWER:
Cross-Site Request Forgery is a security attack where:
A malicious website tricks a logged-in user’s browser into sending an unauthorized request to a trusted website.

The key point:
The user is already authenticated
The browser automatically sends cookies
The server thinks the request is legitimate

2️⃣ Simple real-life example 🧠
Imagine:
You are logged into bank.com
Authentication is stored in a cookie
Now you visit a malicious site:
<img src="https://bank.com/transfer?amount=10000&to=hacker" />
Your browser:
Automatically sends bank cookies
Bank server thinks you made the request
💥 Money transferred without your intent
That’s CSRF.

When CSRF protection is REQUIRED
✅ Web apps using:
Session + cookies
Browser forms
Traditional MVC apps

6️⃣ When CSRF can be DISABLED safely
❌ Not needed when:
No cookies used for auth
Using JWT
Tokens sent in Authorization header
Stateless REST APIs
That’s why we often do:
http.csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable());
