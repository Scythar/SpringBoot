What Is Unit Test:
A unit test is a way to test the smallest parts of your code, such as individual methods or
classes, to ensure they work as expected

Why Unit Testing is Important:
. Fast feedback: Unit tests are quick to run and can immediately tell you if something is broken.
. Early bug detection: Catch bugs at the method level before they propagate.
. Easier to maintain: They help ensure future changes don't break existing functionality.
. Increases confidence: You can refactor your code with the confidence that everything still
works.

⭐ What is the use of BeforeEach and BeforeAll in Junit?
ANSWER:
5️⃣ @BeforeEach (Most Common)
What it does:
Runs before each @Test method
Typical uses:
Initialize objects
Reset variables
Prepare fresh test data

class ProductServiceTest {
    ProductRequestDTO request;
    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        request = new ProductRequestDTO();
        request.setName("Laptop");
        request.setPrice(75000.0);
    }
    @Test
    void testCreateProduct() {
        // uses fresh request object
    }
    @Test
    void testAnotherCase() {
        // again uses fresh request object
    }
}


6️⃣ @BeforeAll (Runs Only Once)
What it does:
Runs only once before all tests

Important rule:
Method must be static (JUnit 5 default)

@BeforeAll
static void init() {
    System.out.println("Runs once");
}
Typical uses
Expensive setup
DB connection
Test container startup
One-time configuration

7️⃣ Execution Order (Very Important)
@BeforeAll   → runs once
@BeforeEach  → runs before test 1
@Test 1
@BeforeEach  → runs before test 2
@Test 2
