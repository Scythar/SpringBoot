⭐What is Entity in Spring boot application?

ANSWER:
an entity is a Java class annotated with @Entity that represents a database table. It is managed by JPA/Hibernate and maps class fields to table columns.

Spring Boot + Hibernate:
Maps this class to a table
Maps fields to columns
Automatically handles CRUD operations
Converts Java object ↔ database row

✅What is JPA?

 JPA (Java Persistence API) is a Java specification that defines how Java objects are mapped, stored, and retrieved from relational databases.
 👉 It provides a standard way to perform ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Java applications.
 JPA is a specification, not an implementation

✅What is Hibernate?

 Hibernate is an ORM (Object–Relational Mapping) framework for Java.
 👉 It implements JPA and provides the actual working code that:
 Maps Java objects to database tables
 Handles SQL generation
 Manages database operations automatically

 What problem does Hibernate solve?
 Without Hibernate (JDBC style)
 Write SQL manually
 Map ResultSet to Java objects
 Handle connections, transactions, exceptions
 With Hibernate
 Work with Java objects only
 Hibernate handles:
 SQL
 Table mapping
 Insert / Update / Delete
 Transactions

⭐ Spring cannot inject database entities. Why?

ANSWER:
Spring can only inject BEANS

Spring manages:Services, Repositories, Controllers
Hibernate manages: Entities

They live in different lifecycles.

2️⃣ Why injecting an entity is conceptually wrong

An entity:
Represents row data
Is created per request / per query
Depends on runtime DB state

If Spring injected an entity:
Which row would it inject?
Which ID?
Which transaction?
❌ That would be impossible.
